# The castle courtyard

A tired majesty is present in the crumbling walls of the castle that surrounds the courtyard. A statue stands in the middle of the square, surveying a motley mixture of huts and market stalls that trespass on the old cobbles and flagstones of the courtyard.

# The tower

Although the roof has collapsed long ago someone has rigged a roof to protect a few pieces of furniture that now make up a snug little living space. Bright sunshine fills the broken tower and through the ragged gaps in the walls the lush green countryside is clearly visible.

# The old throne room

Echoes of ancient finery and the whispers of ghosts fill the air of a room that once played host to the most powerful and important people of the monarch's court.
